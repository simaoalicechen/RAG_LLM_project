During the filling of the reservoir a block of approximately 270 million m3\\ndetached from one wall and slid into the lake at velocities of up to 30 m sec-1 (approx. 110 km h-1). As a result a wave over topped the dam by 250 m and swept onto the valley below, with the loss of about 2500 lives. Remarkably the dam remained unbroken by the flood.\\nLOCATION AND BACKGROUND\\nVajont is located in the south-eastern part of the Dolomite Region of the Italian Alps, about 100 km north of Venice (Fig. 1). It was built as a part of the on-going, post-war development of Italy in order to provide HEP for the rapidly-expanding northern cities of Milan, Turin and Modena.

Whilst there was considerable discussion of the stability of the valley walls in view of the inclined synclinal form of the strata and the possibility of old slides in this area, it was concluded that deep-seated landslides were extremely unlikely as (see Muller 1964 for a review of this):\\n• areas of weakness were not identified in the three test borings;\\n• it was assumed that any shear plane would have a 'chairlike' form that would exert a\\n'braking effect';\\n• seismic analyses had suggest that the banks consisted of very firm in-situ rock with a\\nhigh modulus of elasticity.\\nSmaller slides in the looser surface layers were considered to be likely, although volumes and velocities of movement were expected to be low.\\n\\n2.

By March 1960 the level of the reservoir had reached 130 m above the level of the river, when the first small detachment occurred. Continued filling of the reservoir occurred whilst monitoring of the movements in the banks was undertaken. In October 1960, when the depth of the reservoir had reached 170 metres, a rapid increase in the rate of displacement to approximately 3.5 cm day-1 was observed. At the same time a huge joint of 2 km length opened up, defining an area about 1700 m long and 1000 m wide, suggesting that a very large landslide had been mobilised. On 4 November, with the depth of the reservoir at 180 m, a large failure occurred when 700 000 m 3 of material slid into the lake in about ten minutes. As a result the level of the reservoir was gently dropped back to 135 m.

It is likely that increasing the level of the reservoir drove up pore pressures in the clay layers, reducing the effective normal strength and hence the shear resistance. Resistance to movement was created by the chair-like form of the shear surface. Dropping the level of the reservoir induced hydraulic pressures that increased the stresses as water in the jointed limestone tried to drain. It has been estimated that the total thrust from this effect was 2 - 4 million tonnes (!?) (Muller, 1964). Failure occurred in a brittle manner, inducing catastrophic loss of strength. The speed of movement is probably the result of frictional heating of the pore water in the clay layers (Voight and Faust, 1982, 1992).\\nREFERENCES\\nHendron, A.J., and Patten, F.D, 1985, The Vaiont Slide.

Whilst there was considerable discussion of the stability of the valley walls in view of the inclined synclinal form of the strata and the possibility of old slides in this area, it was concluded that deep-seated landslides were extremely unlikely as (see Muller 1964 for a review of this):\\n• areas of weakness were not identified in the three test borings;\\n• it was assumed that any shear plane would have a 'chairlike' form that would exert a\\n'braking effect';\\n• seismic analyses had suggest that the banks consisted of very firm in-situ rock with a\\nhigh modulus of elasticity.\\nSmaller slides in the looser surface layers were considered to be likely, although volumes and velocities of movement were expected to be low.\\n\\n2.

By March 1960 the level of the reservoir had reached 130 m above the level of the river, when the first small detachment occurred. Continued filling of the reservoir occurred whilst monitoring of the movements in the banks was undertaken. In October 1960, when the depth of the reservoir had reached 170 metres, a rapid increase in the rate of displacement to approximately 3.5 cm day-1 was observed. At the same time a huge joint of 2 km length opened up, defining an area about 1700 m long and 1000 m wide, suggesting that a very large landslide had been mobilised. On 4 November, with the depth of the reservoir at 180 m, a large failure occurred when 700 000 m 3 of material slid into the lake in about ten minutes. As a result the level of the reservoir was gently dropped back to 135 m.

It was realised that a final sudden movement might occur, and it was calculated that, so long as the movement did not exceed a rate that would lead to filling of the reservoir by the landslide in ten minutes or less, over-topping of the dam would be avoided.\\n\\n3. First Draw-Down of the Reservoir\\nCreep had been initiated by the initial filling of the reservoir. As the level was subsequently drawn down, rates of movement decreased from a maximum of about 8 cm day-1 to 3 mm day-1 at a level of 185 m and less than 1 mm day-1 at 135 m.

It is likely that increasing the level of the reservoir drove up pore pressures in the clay layers, reducing the effective normal strength and hence the shear resistance. Resistance to movement was created by the chair-like form of the shear surface. Dropping the level of the reservoir induced hydraulic pressures that increased the stresses as water in the jointed limestone tried to drain. It has been estimated that the total thrust from this effect was 2 - 4 million tonnes (!?) (Muller, 1964). Failure occurred in a brittle manner, inducing catastrophic loss of strength. The speed of movement is probably the result of frictional heating of the pore water in the clay layers (Voight and Faust, 1982, 1992).\\nREFERENCES\\nHendron, A.J., and Patten, F.D, 1985, The Vaiont Slide.

The danger arising for the formation upstream of the slide by an uncontrollable level of the storage lake would have been too great.'Figure 3: Chronology of events leading up to the catastrophic failure\\nThus it was decided that an attempt could be made to gain control of the sliding mass by varying the level of water in the reservoir whilst controlling the joint water thrust within the rock mass by means of drainage tunnels. It was realised that this could lead to the blockage of that section of the reservoir by the landslide mass.

Initially displacements remained high but in December they began to reduce and, by early April when the water height had reached 185 m, the rate was effectively zero. The experiences gained from the second phase of filling and the subsequent draw-down confirmed to the engineers that control of the landslide was possible by altering the level of the reservoir. In consequence a third filling of the reservoir was undertaken.\\n6. Third Filling of the Reservoir\\nBetween April and May 1963 the reservoir level was rapidly increased to 231 m.
